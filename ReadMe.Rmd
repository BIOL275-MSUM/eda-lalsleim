## Abstract

The well conversed Corona Virus, SARS-CoV-2, has hit the world at a fast pace leaving many individuals in a state of distress and panic as it proceeds to cause mild to moderate respiratory illnesses. Although some cases are not deadly, many elderly individuals and individuals with underlying medical illnesses may experience a more severe to deadly effect from the virus. This infectious virus is known to have been commonly spread through droplets of saliva or nose discharge when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Such droplets are usually subject to traveling a few feet away from the initial exposure position within a matter of seconds. Knowing this, a multitude of states have passed mandates such as the continuous wear of face masks and the spacious nature of 6 feet apart in hopes of lessening the spread of this virus. Inquisitive nature has led me to question withier the extremities of each states’ mandates had an affect on the number of infected individuals as well as the survival and death rates of the infected. All of my data will be collected from “The COVID Tracking Project” at The Atlantic, which is data connected directly from the websites of state/territory public health authorities. I will be embarking upon exploratory data analysis from both North Dakota and Minnesota data sets in order to identify which state had the most incline in cases.This will then allow me to identify how each states’ mandates had aided in the prevention of the COVID-19 spread. By identifying the extremities each state had embarked upon, I will be able to further analyze what preventative measures were justifiable to lessening the spread of the Corona Virus.

## Introduction

The well conversed Corona Virus, SARS-CoV-2, has hit the world at a fast pace leaving many individuals in a state of distress and panic as it proceeds to cause mild to moderate respiratory illnesses. This infectious virus is known to have been commonly spread through droplets of saliva or nose discharge when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Such droplets are usually subject to traveling a few feet away from the initial exposure position within a matter of seconds. Knowing this, a multitude of states have passed mandates such as the continuous wear of face masks and the spacious nature of 6 feet apart in hopes of lessening the spread of this virus. I will be identifying whether the extremities of each states’ mandates had an effect on the number of infected individuals. Unfortunately, every state implemented the mask mandates at different times. Due to these differences, each states COVID spreading rates have differed.

## Methods

DATA ACQUISITION

All of my data was collected from “The COVID Tracking Project” (Atlantic covid tracking, 2021) which contains covid data statistics connected directly from the websites of state/territory public health authorities. I did not have to request access to view this website, the information was made public to all those who wanted to view it. In order to accumulate the data for when the mask mandates were passes and lifted I had to visit the “Grand Forks Herald” (Turley, 2021) to accumulate the North Dakota mask mandate and lift dates and “Roseau Northern Minnesota” (Bain, 2020) to accumulate the Minnesota mask mandate date. I also did not have to request access to these websites, for they were made public to all those who wanted to view it. Finally, I gathered the population of both states from the “United States Census Bureau” (United States Census Bureau, 2019).

DATA PREPERATION

In this project I used Rstudio (R Core Team, 2021) to clean up and prepare the COVID data that  I have accumulated. First I loaded the tidyverse package (Wickham et al, 2019) and used the read_csv function to load the data into RStudio. From there I began to make my graphs and rationale my data to fit my base question. 

## Results

The histograms are showing the negative and positive COVID case rates per 1000 people in both North Dakota and Minnesota.

The line graphs are showing the negative and positive COVID case rates per 1000 people while also showing when the mask mandates were implemented and lifted in both North Dakota and Minnesota.

The results show that the implementation of a mask mandate has most definitely saved lives, for the state that had implemented the mask mandate for a longer period of time has shown a lower rate of a positive COVID test score per 1000 people.

## Discussion

Knowing that SARS-CoV-2, also known as the Corona Virus, is commonly spread through droplets of saliva or nose discharge when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, the practical decision to make seems to be taking precautions to distance and cover the mouth and nose at all times. Unfortunately, these measures were not all implemented at the same time within every state. The results that I have grasped have allowed me to narrow my views on the mask mandates implemented by states. It is clear to see that the state that has held down a mask mandate for a longer amount of time has ultimately become the “safer state”. My results have allowed me to compare North Dakota and Minnesota, in which Minnesota has ultimately came out to be the safer state. North Dakota had implemented its mask mandate significantly later than Minnesota on November 14th of 2020 (Turley, 2021), while Minnesota implemented it on July 25th of 2020 (Bain, 2020). Within this time span, we are able to see a significant rate at which the positive COVID cases being reported per 1000 people was somewhat higher in North Dakota then Minnesota. This data proceeds to grow as we analyze the current day situation. On January 18th of 2021, North Dakota had completely lifted its mask mandate (Turley, 2021), while Minnesota had left its mandate untouched. After the mandate was lifted, there was a significant gap in the rate amount of positive COVID tests per 1000 people. It is unfortunate that North Dakota has lifted their mask mandate, for not to long ago, they had reached record breaking levels of positive COVID tests. A great precaution to take in the future is clear to eye; in order to stay safe and healthy one must wear a mask. Although North Dakota has lifted the mask mandate, people living within that state could still wear their masks to ensure their safety until a cure has been processed. I believe that at this point, a mask mandate is exactly what is needed to ensure the greater populations safety, consequently; if an individual wants to stay safe during these times they should wear a mask regardless of their states mandates.
